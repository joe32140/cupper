Hi, I am Joe coming from [Taiwan](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/taiwan)! I am currently an Applied Scientist at Amazon workong on Amazon Q developer to improve project-context understanding for IDE Chat.

I did my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Chicago under supervision of [Prof. Chenhao Tan](https://chenhaot.com) in [Chicago human-AI Interaction (CHAI) lab](https://chicagohai.github.io/). My research focused on applying NLP on large corpora to better understand and support human decision-making. 

I spent a wonderful year at University of Colorado Boulder before transferred to UChicago. 
Before joining CU, I was a research assistant in Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis Lab (NLPSA) at Academia Sinica supervised by [Dr. Lun-Wei Ku](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/). 
Prior to that, I got a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at National Taiwan University and did undergraduate research with [Prof. Lin-shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) on utterance-level emotion recognition in speech.
