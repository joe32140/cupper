I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder under supervision of [Prof. Chenhao Tan](https://chenhaot.com). My current research focuses on information solicitation which aims to extract valuable information from the noisy dataset.


Before joining CU, I was a research assistant in Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis Lab (NLPSA) at Academia Sinica supervised by [Dr. Lun-Wei Ku](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/). My research at NLPSA included modeling language in discourse by deep learning model with applications among dialogue emotion recognition and visual storytelling. Prior to that, I got a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at National Taiwan University and did undergraduate research with [Prof. Lin-shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) on utterance-level emotion recognition in speech.
