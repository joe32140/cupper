I am going to be a PhD student in Computer Science at University of Colorado Boulder under supervision of [Prof. Chenhao Tan](https://chenhaot.com). My research focuses on modeling language in discourse by deep learning model with applications among dialogue emotion recognition and visual storytelling. I am a research assistant in Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis Lab (NLPSA) at Academia Sinica supervised by [Dr. Lun-Wei Ku](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/). Before joining NLPSA, I got bachelor degree in Computer Science at National Taiwan University and did undergraduate research with [Prof. Lin-shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm).
