I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago under supervision of [Prof. Chenhao Tan](https://chenhaot.com). My current research focuses on information solicitation which aims to characterize valuable information from the noisy dataset and facilitates a more effective data recording process.

I spent a wonderful year at University of Colorado Boulder before transferred to UChicago. 
Before joining CU, I was a research assistant in Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis Lab (NLPSA) at Academia Sinica supervised by [Dr. Lun-Wei Ku](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/). 
My research at NLPSA included modeling language in discourse by deep learning model with applications among dialogue emotion recognition and visual storytelling. 
Prior to that, I got a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at National Taiwan University and did undergraduate research with [Prof. Lin-shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) on utterance-level emotion recognition in speech.
